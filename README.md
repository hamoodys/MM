Memorial to Muhammad Ali

Muhammad Ali was infamous for some of the most memorable quotes:
* __"Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee."__
* "Don't count the days, make the days count."
* "He who is not courageous enough to take risks will accomplish nothing in life."

Muhammad Ali is famous for his boxing bravado, and his ability to deliver on his word (sometimes loud). When he spoke in his bold manner, his exagerated showmanship both impressed and intimidated other boxers, boxing fans, and the media of his time.
